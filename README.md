# Week 3 Project ‚Äì Classification task using algorithms

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on building a **text classification model** using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.  
It demonstrates preprocessing with **NLTK**, model training with **scikit-learn**, and deployment using a **Gradio interface** for real-time predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Text preprocessing using:
  - Regex cleaning
  - Stopword removal (NLTK)
- Feature extraction with **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Classification using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation with **classification report**
- Interactive **Gradio app** for predictions
